# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.7
#
# Build all scilaxy-relay binaries in one shared cargo-chef pass, then
# split into per-binary runtime images via the `BIN` build-arg. The
# alternative — four independent Dockerfiles — would re-download the
# entire dependency graph four times in CI; this layout shares the
# `cargo chef cook` cache across all four targets.
#
# Build:
#   docker build --build-arg BIN=stream     -t scilaxy-relay-stream:dev .
#   docker build --build-arg BIN=control    -t scilaxy-relay-control:dev .
#   docker build --build-arg BIN=rendezvous -t scilaxy-relay-rendezvous:dev .
#   docker build --build-arg BIN=relay      -t scilaxy-relay-relay:dev .
#
# Each binary is a self-contained statically-linked-ish binary (libc
# only) that listens on a single port — see crate-specific README for
# the contract. The runtime image is a minimal debian:bookworm-slim;
# we deliberately do NOT use `scratch` because (a) the binaries link
# against libssl / libcrypto via reqwest's rustls in some crates so
# we need ca-certificates, and (b) `kubectl exec` debugging on a
# running pod is far easier with a real /bin/sh.
